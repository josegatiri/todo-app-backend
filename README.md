# Todo Backend

This is a robust and scalable backend for a Todo application, built with a focus on rapid development, security, and clear API documentation.

## Architecture and Stack

* **Framework:** Django + Django REST Framework (DRF) for rapid, secure APIs.
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) via `djangorestframework-simplejwt` for secure user authentication.
* **Database:**
  * **Development:** SQLite for ease of local setup.
  * **Production (Optional):** PostgreSQL for a more robust and scalable production environment.
* **API Documentation:** `drf-spectacular` for generating OpenAPI 3 schemas, providing interactive Swagger UI and Redoc interfaces for easy API exploration.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

* Provide a complete and functional backend for a Todo application.
* Demonstrate best practices in Django and DRF development.
* Implement secure user authentication and authorization.
* Offer clear and interactive API documentation.
* Be easily deployable and scalable.
